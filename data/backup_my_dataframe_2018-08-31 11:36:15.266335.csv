I played Brass: Birmingham over the weekend and have to say it was quite possibly the best game I’ve ever played. 

We played with a group of 4, all of whom have never played it nor the original. We watched the “Watch it Played” video together, remarked that the video took almost as long as our entire game of Container, and then felt ready to go. I felt that we were pretty solid getting through it for first timers, after set up the game only took 90 minutes. We only got 1 rule wrong the entire game and it wasn’t so much “Wrong” as we just forgot something “Special” with a card type. We all forgot until the very end that if you use a city card, you can play an industry in that city without it being connected to your grid. We kept adding to our grids and might have missed some opportunity. There were some obtuseness to the rules such as constantly having to remember the distinction between “The” Grid, “Your” Grid and being “Connected” and every resource needing a unique combination of those 3 terms, but we had it under control after a while

About 30-40 minutes before the game ended I was starting at the board thinking “This is amazing. Absolutely amazing, this is one of the best gaming experiences I’ve ever had”. I was completely in love with how organically the board state was unfolding and the decisions I had the opportunity to make. The theme and components did such a good job of pulling me in and the possibility space of the game was brilliant. It’s the type of game that constantly adjusts based on what people are doing. We all started the game by picking a corner and building up on our own, it felt weird and I’m not sure how common that was, Birmingham itself didn’t get heavily developed until the very very end of the game. We ran out of iron cube components because people were building iron mines early and developing, I wondered to myself “How many people actually do this at the start of the game? Are we being weird? Did we run out of iron cubes because no one thought any group would do these terrible actions”. The tension through the game to go first was palpable. Every time the supply dropped you could see people planning and vibrating to be the first one to build an industry that filled it back up to get the auto flipped tile. Our supplies never dropped very much because everyone was ready to pounce. 

The card discard/hand mechanic that controls the entire game… is BRILLIANT. Listening to it in a video makes if feel finicky but once you’re actually playing the game you see the brilliance of its elegance. Being able to see clearly how many turns are left makes actions quantifiable and gives weight to every decisions. Setting your cards aside to use the weaker ones for canals/rails and trying to do the best with what you have gives a strong tactical element to the game. 

On the changes, I will say just about everything just “Made sense”. The scout action is better than the discarding 2 cards to use as any city. Being able to take loans until the end of the game just makes sense, also the game stops you from being dumb and only offers 30$ loans. The way Cotton/Manufacturer/Pottery is shipped seems to make so much more sense. I like the random placement of markets, it gives the game interesting twists when the pottery tiles are all on the very south. I love breweries, I think the third resource adds a lot. The only “Slight” disappointment I would have is that there is nothing quite like the “Shipyard” tiles where you spend a lot and just SLAM down VPs. I would have liked that. Pottery is close with the need to develop and huge victory points gains, but it still needs to be shipped to flip. Also Manufacturing and Cotton mills are just a bit too similar in game terms for my liking. They have small detail changes from tile to tile, but on a whole feel way too similar. I would have preferred a different mechanic to one of them. 

Our game ended with one person really far ahead and all 3 other players within a point of each other, 2 of them were tied. Despite criticism, this outcome was not foreseen at the end of the canal era, it was still anyone’s game. Even though the points were very far apart after the canal era there were so many swings in the railroad era that completely reshaped the VP track. I just wanted to sit back and talk about the mechanics for hours after. I made a push to get the resources for constant double rail actions near the end, loading connections around Birmingham. One player made a nice long line early in the game but it was through cities that no one developed really hurting that investment. I had a few early breweries up, and when everyone started really building breweries the market was then flooded, most of them weren’t flipped while all of mine were.

I just want to play the game again and again. Looking at the Lancashire rules I feel like there won’t be much reason to play it more than Birmingham. The minor tweaks smooth out some issues, and the way the Foreign Market/Harbor mechanics were changed is for the better I feel. This game is truly a masterpiece of design. I feel like we’ll be talking about it for the next 10 years.

Pottery is close with the need to develop and huge victory points gains, but it still needs to be shipped to flip. Also Manufacturing and Cotton mills are just a bit too similar in game terms for my liking. They have small detail changes from tile to tile, but on a whole feel way too similar. I would have preferred a different mechanic to one of them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our game ended with one person really far ahead and all 3 other players within a point of each other, 2 of them were tied. Despite criticism, this outcome was not foreseen at the end of the canal era, it was still anyone’s game. Even though the points were very far apart after the canal era there were so many swings in the railroad era that completely reshaped the VP track. I just wanted to sit back and talk about the mechanics for hours after. I made a push to get the resources for constant double rail actions near the end, loading connections around Birmingham. One player made a nice long line early in the game but it was through cities that no one developed really hurting that investment. I had a few early breweries up, and when everyone started really building breweries the market was then flooded, most of them weren’t flipped while all of mine were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want to play the game again and again. Looking at the Lancashire rules I feel like there won’t be much reason to play it more than Birmingham. The minor tweaks smooth out some issues, and the way the Foreign Market/Harbor mechanics were changed is for the better I feel. This game is truly a masterpiece of design. I feel like we’ll be talking about it for the next 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;

I went through and organized the 500+ posts into a Google spreadsheet.

This would have been a lot easier to do if submissions for these top 5 posts were always in a fixed format.

1. first game
2. second game
3. third game
4. fourth game
5. fifth game

Anyway, I digress.

There were 395 unique games submitted. The number would have been much more than 400 if I had included ""Honorable Mention"" games. I also didn't include any games that were 6+ in a particular post since the question was about the top 5.

Approximately 50% of the games were only nominated by 1 person. The number of games nominated by only 2 people was nearly another 25%.

Here are the top games that received 10 or more nominations:

* Scythe - 30
* Spirit Island - 29
* Gloomhaven - 28
* Concordia - 23
* Carcassonne - 22
* Terraforming Mars - 22
* Agricola - 21

Happy Tuesday, /r/boardgames!

This is a weekly thread to discuss train games and 18xx games, which are a family of economic train games consisting of shared ownership in railroad companies. For more information, [see the description on BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/19/18xx). There’s also a subreddit devoted entirely to 18xx games, /r/18xx, and a subreddit devoted entirely to **[Age of Steam](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4098/age-steam)**, /r/AgeOfSteam.

Here’s a nice guide on [how to get started with 18xx](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/4sygx3/how_to_get_started_with_18xx/?st=iqny4loj&amp;sh=c01b5d88).

Feel free to discuss anything about train games, including recent plays, what you're looking forward to, and any questions you have. 

If you want to arrange to play some 18xx or other train games online, feel free to try to arrange a game with people via /r/playboardgames.

​

Not sure if this is really the best tread to post this on, but I saw another old api question here so I figured I'd give it a try. Feel free to redirect me if there is a better thread.

​

I'm currently trying to pull information on Boardgames from the BGG xml api. The flow is something like this:

User enters boardgame name as a search-&gt;

script polls the api for games matching that name and returns the results-&gt;

User picks the correct result-&gt;

script takes the boardgame ID from the picked result and polls the api again using the ID which gives all the needed info.

​

Here is the output I receive from the search:

    &lt;boardgames termsofuse=""[https://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse](https://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse)""&gt;
    		&lt;boardgame objectid=""238032""&gt;
    
    		&lt;name primary=""true""&gt;Betrayal at Baldur\&amp;#039;s Gate and House on the Hill Promo Cards&lt;/name&gt;			
    &lt;yearpublished&gt;2017&lt;/yearpublished&gt;
    &lt;/boardgame&gt;
    
    		&lt;boardgame objectid=""10547""&gt;
    
    		&lt;name primary=""true""&gt;Betrayal at House on the Hill&lt;/name&gt;			
    &lt;yearpublished&gt;2004&lt;/yearpublished&gt;
    &lt;/boardgame&gt;
    
    		&lt;boardgame objectid=""198452""&gt;
    
    		&lt;name primary=""true""&gt;Betrayal at House on the Hill: Widow\&amp;#039;s Walk&lt;/name&gt;			
    &lt;yearpublished&gt;2016&lt;/yearpublished&gt;
    &lt;/boardgame&gt;
    
    &lt;/boardgames&gt;\

I can handle everything else from there. The issue I'm having, is that the boardgame's ID is wrapped up in an xml tag, and I can't figure out how to get the script to access that information. I can see the ID when I look at the output in the logs, but I can't figure out how to pull the ID into a variable. I have basically no xml experience which I'm sure is why I can't figure out something that seems fairly simple. I'm using google apps script on a google sheet (basically javascript). Any thoughts or suggestions would be much appreciated!

Mah bad.

[We played for the first time last night](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/204516/878-vikings-invasions-england) and my friend and I (as the Vikings) lost in what was probably the quickest ever session of that game, end of round 2 (out of a possible 7 rounds).

​Our strategy involved kind of staying defensive of the few towns we got in the beginning, and slowly expanding out from there. However, after they whittled down our main attacking force in a battle where they got like 5 Fyrd reinforcements added to their army, they got two turns in a row and just swept completely through the remaining towns that had like 4 Norsemen in each one, and just to add insult to injury, converted the very last two men we had on the board for the win.

​​Now, I'm willing to consider, perhaps even assume, that we just suck at area control wargames, which isn't an issue.

​However, is staying defensive and holding onto the few towns you get in the beginning the wrong strategy? Should we be trying to shock them by spearing through the countryside and forcing them to leave other towns vulnerable by devoting men to stopping the spearhead, while we take advantage of that with new leaders and reinforcements that come at the beginning of each round?

I recently did some visualizations of the data on BGG and part of it was a *network visualization* of the board game categories to see what they are and how they relate to each other. I think it looks quite nice and therefore I decided to share it with you. I'll leave all the interpretation to you. First, a few short paragraphs of explanations.

- [Using Ratings and Weights](https://imgur.com/b109YKO)
- For more check out the ""More Stuff"" section at the bottom

## The Data

I did *not* use *all* of the data that BGG offers. I only included board games with at least 20 rating votes that have been released in 1990-2018 and excluded expansions. I collected the data in May 2018 where these constraints resulted in 15520 board games. Yes, you can download the data if you want to. The data is stored in a *SQLite* database that you can download [here](https://github.com/janbrrr/board-game-analysis/blob/master/data/database/data_2018-05-10.db). You can find a reference of the tables [here](https://github.com/janbrrr/board-game-analysis/blob/master/database_schema.png).

## What a Network Visualization is

As the name already suggests, a network visualization is a visualization of a *network*.  A network consists of *nodes* and *edges*.  In this case the nodes are the board game categories listed on BGG. An edge between two nodes indicates a *relationship* between both nodes. The *weight* of this edge indicates how strong this relationship is. What this exactly means is explained in the next part. After obtaining the nodes and edges, the next step is to apply a *layout algorithm* that takes the information about the edges and arranges/positions the nodes in a map such that the connections are respected. In other words, nodes connected by edges should end up spatially close, while unconnected nodes should end up far apart from each other. If the nodes are categories and an edge represents a relationship between two categories, categories that are related to each other should end up spatially close to each other.

The software I used to do this is called [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) and I used *Force Atlas 2* as layout algorithm. This algorithm applies forces that cause the nodes to ""repulse each other like charged particles, while edges attract their nodes, like springs"" [(paper)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0098679#s2).

## Calculating the Edge Weights

The weight of an edge between two categories should be an indicator of how important both categories are for each other. The metric we will use is how often the two categories *co-occur* in board games. To be more precise, we calculate the co-occurrence in percent from the perspective of each of the two categories and add the results. This results in a maximum value of 200 if both categories only exist together.

It is much more obvious if you look at the formulas. Here is how to calculate an edge between two categories c0 and c1: [formula](https://imgur.com/ZKsE8fS)

This is not my idea, this approach is based on [Kriesel's work](http://www.dkriesel.com/blog/2016/1028_spiegelmining_think_big._die_artikellandschaft_der_letzten_zwei_jahre_zum_selberforschen) (it's in german).

## The Network Visualization

I suggest you to prepare some expectations of what categories you think go hand in hand. With that being said, I removed some very niche categories due to a lack of data.

[Click here](https://imgur.com/igiBfcT) to view the network visualization. Categories are sized according to the number of board games they appear in and colored according to detected communities. Big categories appear in more board games than small categories. Categories of the same color are assumed to belong to the same type of categories (i.e., they form a community).

## Adding Ratings and Complexity Ratings

We have two visual channels to display information: the node size and the color. Let's use them to display the *average rating* and the *average complexity rating*.

Now the categories are sized according to the average complexity of board games that feature this category. Small categories feature mostly simple games, while big categories mostly feature complex games.

The color of a category (a gradient from blue to red) will showcase the average rating of board games that feature this category. Blue categories feature lower rated board games, while red categories feature higher rated board games.

Again, I suggest to think of some expectations, that's more fun. [Here is the result](https://imgur.com/b109YKO).

## More Stuff

**Lovecraft Mythos** themes, even though I like a few games which employ them (like Elder Sign, even though it's essentially Yatzeethulhu).

**Nerd culture/""gamer""** themes, full of geeky injokes or parodies (think Munchkin, Chez Geek etc).

**Star Wars**, or really most pop culture branded tie-ins. I'd rather they go the Twilight Imperium route and design their own IP drawing on archetypes from the genre. 

**Anime/Chibi-inspired visuals** (Arcadia Quest, Flash Duel) totally kill any interest I could have in a game. 

**8-bit/'retro'** video game-inspired games (Boss Monster et al). It's weird, because NES and SNES platformers are my favourite style of video games, but as a board game theme it just seems hokey.

Starting the conversation: 

Shut up and Sit Down are hands down my favourite, even when I don't agree they are so good at articulating what a game FEELS like and what they do or don't like about it that the review is always informative (and usually super entertaining to boot!)

I've always enjoyed Tom Vasel (and Miami Dice by extension), he was the first reviewer I got into and I've realised his tastes line up well with mine, so I can generally feel pretty confident in his recommendations. He generally conveys the rules well without getting bogged down in minutae... Useful when I want a better understanding of the nuts and bolts which SUSD don't usually convey in detail.

As for under serviced niche, personally I just found the Three Minute Review series, which I think is great. Its rare that I want to sit through a extended reviews, and often I just want/need an ""at a glance"" review of a game, from which I can usually tell if a game is for me.

I found this sub-reddit after trying to find peoples resolutions to this issue, though did not find any.

I was playing games over the weekend with some friends. I had just played for my turn and realized that another player could win next turn. I pointed this out to the table since I, and I assume the other players, do not want this to happen. This resulted in a conversation about Table Talk, and the one player was annoyed at my statement, and has been upset about pointing these kinds of things out in the past with other games.

Is it wrong to point out to someone what is happening? I try not to tell people what to do when it comes to these situations, but I do not have any problem pointing this out, especially on a board where the information is freely available.

The player feels that it is up to each player to pay attention themselves without it being pointed out to them. I feel that if a player is doing something I should be able to if I want to. There are times I may NOT want to tell someone what a player is doing, cause it will benefit me in some way. In the end, I want to win as that is the goal of the game. I would not ""assist"" a player unless it benefits me in some way. Someone else winning it me losing. It is just extremely annoying for me to have to hold back from pointing out someone winning the game.

I’m a big fan of party-games, and this is a trend I cannot ignore. For me, it’s super important that party-games are portable, because I’ll be bringing them to parties (duh). And when the games are competing in my backpack for space with booze, clothing and other games, it pisses me off that so many of them waste space!

I get that a lot of boardgames leave space for expansions, but some still take it too far. Also, I’m confident that most don’t buy expansions, and the people that do probably won’t mind buying a bigger collector’s box.

First, how to do it right:

[Joking Hazard](https://i.imgur.com/ESVMrvZ.jpg)  
It’s small, compact and still has some room for expansions. And they sell bigger boxes specifically for the people that collect expansions!

The box may be medium-sized, but is still more than twice as big as the cards included! I get it, “It’s for expansions!”. But seriously, twice as big? And regardless of expansions, what’s with the inch-wide border in the middle?

I thought Descent would be a worthy follow-up, but its linearity and pure focus on complex combat put me off. It took two hours to set up the game, even with an experienced DM. And once the scenario started it was tiny with only one goal. 

In Hero Quest I had the ability to add extra flair to the game, with secret doors, monsters with personalities and extra rooms. I would even make my own treasure/weaponry cards. And the combat was so easy, any family member could join in. 

Is there any games out that has the same versatility?

And let's break it down, since I know so many people are looking for the same. 

What was awesome about Hero Quest?
This guy said it best.

* Awesome miniatures (and so simple/generic!)
* Awesome furniture, including THE DOORS!
* Fantastic, simple cards
* The beautiful board with procedural exploration (though I do love modular boards)
* The Quest Book - Lots of different scenarios, shown on just 2 pages each!
* The Box! Gosh do I love the art!
* GM Screen - My inspiration for all GameMasterings since! 
* Simple combat mechanics ( I don't mind more complex rules, but some overdo it)
* Expansions!


Here's my impression on current 'Hero Quest' successors stack up to that list!


**[Dungeon Saga](https://www.amazon.com/Mantic-Games-Dungeon-Saga-Dwarf/dp/B014IUO0NU#customerReviews)**
This REALLY looks awesome. Lots of expansions. Solid art style. Physical props. Simple treasure cards. Nice miniatures. Oooh, and are those door ways?! I like! 

But I have quality concerns. Sounds like the rulebook is a bit of a mess, games will show up damaged and it's a $100 investment to get it all. I don't mind putting in $120 and more for this game, but then it needs to be Hero Quest Quality with capital Q at least. :-)

**Gloomhaven**
Definitely a top contender, but I'm still trying to wrap my head around what the game actually is. Does it even have a GameMaster function? 

**Dungeons and Dragons Board Games**
Thanks for this suggestion! I didn't know you could combine these games. That's really interesting. But the maps I've seen so far were pretty uninspired and anything related to 4th edition is something I'm not sure about. Should I give it a go?

**Descent (2nd Ed)**
As mentioned above; I loved the look and feel of Descent , but for my purposes (getting my wife and beginners into RPG's) the game was too complex and felt too linear. The scenario starts and you must move from point A to point B, with no additional exploration or fun. 

In Hero Quest the GameMaster had the quiet choice of adding or removing a minion to make the game harder or easier for the players. Making such a decision in Descent didn't seem like an option as it'd leave a gaping hole in the plot. I only played 3 scenarios, so I could be wrong. 

**Massive Darkness**
Lots to like here, but it seems to lack the GM function and custom scenario parts I loved about Hero Quest. 

**[Warhammer Quest - Shadows of Hammerhal](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/218933/warhammer-quest-shadows-over-hammerhal)**
Giving this a look now. I might be able to overcome the Warhammer stigma if there's some flexibility in making your own maps here. Hmmm. 

**Mice &amp; Mystics**
Love the look, but from what I understand this is a very scenario, railroaded game. 


**Arcadia Quest**
If I can overcome the artstyle (it's well done, but not my cup of cute), I still don't like that there's only 9 map tiles in the game?


**Imperial Assault**
Love the game, but I have the same concerns as with Descent. Plus the setting isn't what I need. Gotta get me some sword and sorcery!

The only downside is that when you have friends that have a lot of boardgames, they hardly want to play the same thing multiple times (with a few exceptions to the rule, of course). That can lead to you playing a game that you absolutely *loved,* without much hope of playing it again for quite some time.


Of course that normally means you just get to play more games and that's awesome, but it begs the question:


*What games have you played only once that you are just aching to play again?*


I think my top two are: 

**Deus**: The box art and theme are so boring that I would never have picked this game up unless my friend convinced me it was good. He told me ""After playing this game, you'll never need to play another engine builder again."" And my gods was he right. I mean, I'm going to play another engine builder at some stage of my life, but this one just hit all the right buttons for me. The compounding actions and simple, easy to read board/strategy was just perfect for me. 


**Inis**: It's just beautiful and simple and complex and I love it. There's more than enough people going on about how good this game is so I'll leave it up to them.

Just wanting to know so I don't annoy people in the future.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hobby is all about sharing, and I love that so very much. The only downside is that when you have friends that have a lot of boardgames, they hardly want to play the same thing multiple times (with a few exceptions to the rule, of course). That can lead to you playing a game that you absolutely &lt;em&gt;loved,&lt;/em&gt; without much hope of playing it again for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course that normally means you just get to play more games and that&amp;#39;s awesome, but it begs the question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What games have you played only once that you are just aching to play again?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think my top two are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deus&lt;/strong&gt;: The box art and theme are so boring that I would never have picked this game up unless my friend convinced me it was good.

For example perhaps doubling actions from all spots in viticulture may speed the game up and not affect too many dynamics other than increase the strength of blocking. 

Doubling resources gained or even just increasing the starting resources in terraforming mars would make the game play at a very fast rate (although some cards might be stronger than others)

Doubling the resources and halving the rounds in terra mystica would make the game play faster, but would definitely ruin the balance dynamics (R1 plays would be too strong wrt round bonus).

They tell stories and communicate ideas and emotions. In order to take them seriously as art I feel that board game critics could do with being a little more... critical. When I am watching The Dice Tower, Rahdo or, worst of all, Man vs Meeple, I get the feeling that despite talking about other aspects of the game like component quality, length of play, theme, etc, the reviews often boil down to ""did I have fun playing this game"".

""What's wrong with that?"" I hear you ask. After all, isn't fun the most important thing? And, it is, but here's the kicker... **you can have fun playing a bad game!** Anyone who has enjoyed the deeply flawed monopoly as a kid should know this. Enjoying a bad game doesn't make you bad, or stupid, or wrong, and there are plenty of reasons why you might enjoy a bad game. Maybe it just scratches a certain itch that makes you overlook its flaws. Cool, You do you! However, when it comes to professional critics I expect some deeper evaluation. If I want player reviews, I'll go to BGG.

Just compare the difference between movie reviews and board game reviews. Audiences tend to focus on the raw emotional ""did I enjoy this"", while critics will examine pacing, character development, themes (I don't just mean genre, I mean what is the movie ""saying"") and cinematography. This is why Rotten Tomatoes has separate audience and critic reviews.  I personally loved the first Resident Evil movie, despite it being destroyed by critics, and The Transformers movie has 85% positive reviews from audience members, but only 57% positive reviews from critics.

Art is subjective and we like what we like, but there is often a theory behind art that provides a basis for critical evaluation e.g. in music theory we can talk about ""colour"" or ""tension"". This is why critics of other mediums often come to similar conclusions e.g. The Lord Of The Rings is good, 50 Shades Of Grey is bad (despite 50 shades of grey having a massive following). Meanwhile, amongst board game critics you tend to get wildly different evaluations of the same game with no consistency of theory. This is becoming more and more important with the share number of board games being produced these days.

With that, we're having trouble figuring out exactly what happens when one group attacks another group. Currently, we have similar battle elements (infantry, cavalry, and artillery) able to 'group up' if they're all the same type and increase their strength points. 

For example, let's say three cavalry with a combined strength of 6pts attacks an four person infantry unit, or 4pts for strength. Clearly the cavalry wins, but at what cost exactly? We figure that the infantry are all taken off the board, but it would make sense for the cavalry (or whatever the winning element or group is) to take a small hit like they would in regular battle.

Any ideas on what we can do for this?

&amp;#x200B;

My friends and I have gotten into playing board games recently and it's a nice diversion to playing video game all the time or other stuff. We have played Forbidden Island quite a bit over the months, and finally got the Desert version. I like this one a lot but I had a couple questions that I just wanted to clarify. Thanks for the help!

&amp;#x200B;

1. If you use the gadget card binoculars to peek under one of the tiles, and by doing that you know for certain the whereabouts of a ship part, can you place the part on the correct tile and go get it? Or do you need to flip over both artifact clue tiles before you can go to the right place to get it?

2. We only played a few games so far, but are we playing the water carrier right? He/she seems far and away the best character. So as long as you are adjacent to another player, you can exchange one of your water points for theirs, for the cost of one action. The carrier can also get two water out of a well even after it's been flipped later in the game, and receive two waters each action. I think this is correct, it just seems better then other characters. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

You can use &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template-no-explainer""&gt;this template&lt;/a&gt; to do so. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a version with explanations of what we&amp;#39;re looking for.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you reply to any comment that has a game name in &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt; with &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/r2d8""&gt;/u/r2d8&lt;/a&gt; getparentinfo&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;, one of our robots will tell you more about the game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember that this is a community full of awesome, helpful people, and feel free to ask your questions whatever they may be. As always, keep it civil and remember what the downvote button is actually for.&lt;/p&gt;

My list is currently:

**Bayonets and Tomahawks**: Dare I say it a chit pushing wargame that looks...elegant? The topic is right up my alley, but the chit design, intuitive thought out custom dice (I'm a sucker for custom faced dice), the lack of CRT, the operational scale, the unique attrition system. I just want it to be 2019 to get this game. 

&amp;nbsp;

**The US Civil War**: I may end up pulling this if the p500 doesn't fill quickly, and just buy used on BGG. I want this game badly. The massive, mounted map is exactly what I love (looking at you Napoleons Triumph). I don't have a huge strategic wargame, and this one seems much more manageable then some of the other 3000 hours ones. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Andean Abyss**: The deeper questions and problems that Root works to address led me straight into the arms of COIN. Im interested in many of the games but have to start with one to see if I love it. The real guerilla nature of the factions in Andean Abyss vs the government really appeal to me, as does the Columbian cartel theme. Lucky for me September kicks off COINCfest, so perfect timing. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Imperial Struggle** I've enjoyed the Twilight Struggle app but the Cold War is an incredibly bland theme to me. 18th century Twilight Struggle? I'm on board. This p500 has been up for 2 years but hopefully we see a print mid 2019 as they've posted. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Nevsky**: Volko Ruhnke is my hero. This new system of feudal obligation, the difficulty of running a medieval campaign during a feudal season, the operational scale involving logistics and supply. I am very excited for this game, and have been following interviews closely in it's development. I have a feel this will be a new groundbreaking engine. Volko says he's hoping to do England vs Longshanks for the next game, and I know I'll be a day one backer if this system pans out. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Versailles 1919**: A highly thematic and historical negotiation, bidding, political game that work 4p, 2p, AND solo? This is going to sit very happily next to John Company in my weird, cool, history game shelf. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Flying Colors**: This will be the first hex and counter in my collection. I am a huge 18th century naval warfare buff, so this has a huge appeal to me. I own Sail of Glory and while I enjoy it, the fleet actions and scale of Flying Colors will play much better I think. Very close to hitting 500 so hopefully a reprint soon.

&amp;nbsp;

**The Last Hundred Yards**: Above all the games on the list, this feels the most groundbreaking. A fast playing hex and counter, the reaction and initiative mechanic seems incredible. A game without simultaneous action selection that creates a feeling of simultaneous control. The fact that units only react instead of act when not using initiative means that flanking is a very viable play, and the system of dissaray means a counterattack is a reaction with serious punch. I am very very excited for this one.

From a [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/9aiz9c/boardgame_critics_need_to_be_more_critical/):

&gt;Like books, movies, and video games, I feel that board games are an art form. 

Great post. I agree with most of it, except for the idea that board games are an art form.

Board games *contain* art forms, but they're not art. They're games. (QED (jk)). They're more closely related to parlour games, which also contain artistic elements such as story-telling, acting.

I feel that that art is created to evoke a particular mood or engage with a certain philosophy or though process. While board games *can* do that, they're primarily created to entertain you.

And that's okay. It doesn't make them less valuable. They don't have to be art to be important. 

Games have intrinsic value. They're a cultural artifact wherein one of us put a lot of time and effort in entertaining the rest of us. 

Board games a form of play.

&gt;Play, you say? **Play!?!!?!** Only *chiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiildren* play!

Nah. I mean sure, historically this is true, but it was a pleasure we denied ourselves because of societal values, not an inevitable consequence of adulthood.

Play's important, and modern board games are a recognition of that. 

When we play, we create a shared and unique experience that's only made possible by the rules of the game. Someone provides the bottle, and we bring the lightning. It's socially engaging, it's humanizing, and it provokes thought.

Shortly put, play is healthy, whatever age you may be. 

Could we have our board games without art, be it visual or literary? No. But I don't think something *is* art just because it *contains* art.

There's no right answer here. I'm not art-shaming. 

Whether or not the definition of art should include the particularly high degree of interaction and variation that board games provide, I do think the definition of board games should embrace that it's a game - a form of play - and, as a rare and healthy expression of humanity, terribly important.

In PotR you invest in various cities and try to help the ones you're invested in win wars and gain influence which in turn will make your investments worth more points in the end game. You start auctions for influence in a given city, buy troops to help you in wars, or start wars. 

It's a very unique system, and it's really fun to play the politics game without actually being a faction on the board. However, PotR is an older game with some rough edges. The main problems:

* A wildly unbalanced card deck, and you obtain cards through random draw.
* d6 combat system, so a simple die roll could end up with a +/-5 to your attack or defense value. This is made exponentially bad because combat is super rare, so the dice will not mitigate over time, nor are there many ways to mitigate them through abilities.
* Too few wars allowed per age and they get used fast. More wars would allow more interesting manipulation and intrigue.

 This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter tabletop games projects that are either:

 - **newly posted in the past 7 days**, or
 - **ending in the next 7 days (starting tomorrow)** and have at least a fighting chance of being funded.

 All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, no need to ask. (But the occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!)

 Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between 12:00am and 12:00pm PST.

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this is:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter tabletop games projects that are either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;newly posted in the past 7 days&lt;/strong&gt;, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ending in the next 7 days (starting tomorrow)&lt;/strong&gt; and have at least a fighting chance of being funded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, no need to ask. (But the occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between 12:00am and 12:00pm PST.&lt;/p&gt;

1. I explain the goal of the game, the main concept and how game turns go.
2. I go into more details what kinds of things you can do in a turn, and what to expect.
3. One to two people start yawning because they cannot remember all the stuff mentioned till now, and request that we just do a ""quick try"" and they will ask questions along the way.
4. First game starts, and they do ask questions. However, each of them asks questions for almost everything they see (i.e. for each card effect), and then spends some more time deciding what to do. This process takes a lot of time.
5. If I tell them to hurry up, as I make all my moves in a few seconds, they get annoyed saying I have already known all the rules so I should be patient.
6. As the game goes on, they gradually ""understand"" the game, but still make arbitrary moves because they are are not familiar with the game enough. They still spend a lot of time making decisions which ultimately do not mean much since the play is supposed to be a ""quick try"" before the real play.
7. First play ends, and it takes much longer than anticipated (\~3 hours for Blood Rage, 4.5 - 5 hours for Terraforming Mars).
8. Besides a few gamer friends, most complain ""Let's play something else now since this game takes too long"" and they will spread the incorrect view of these games being ""extremely lengthy"" to other friends.

With one of the sub-group, I insisted that we try Blood Rage one more time with the same number of people, and the second game with this group only took \~60 - 70 minutes, definitely much more in line with general expectation. The other sub-group, however, now think quite badly of Mars and Blood Rage because the first plays were too long for them.

Knowing that these same people really enjoy strategy games when they reach a certain level of proficiency, **how should I organize the first play of relatively heavy games**? I don't want to rush through the first play too quickly since the essence of strategic decision making may be lost. On the other hand, letting them take their time drags the first play for too long, and these same people become bored in the process and do not want to come back for a 2nd try.

It is quite a lengthy post but I hope I have made my question clear enough.

I don&amp;#39;t want to rush through the first play too quickly since the essence of strategic decision making may be lost. On the other hand, letting them take their time drags the first play for too long, and these same people become bored in the process and do not want to come back for a 2nd try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is quite a lengthy post but I hope I have made my question clear enough. Thanks in advance for any input.&lt;/p&gt;

Do you like Boardgames with assistant apps or do you think everything have to be analog.

Do you know some boardgames, that have good apps? 

and what do you want, that a boardgame assistant app can do?
 for example: just timer (if necessary), setup description, Solo variant... ?


Some boardgames with app I know are EXIT, where the App descriped the setup and make sound while the timer is running, and Clue DVD (not directly an app, but game assistant), where the butler, gives hints from time to time, if you playing a scenario.

One, when the app says target a hero or attack a hero can familiars be the target of that attack?

Also, we played on hard difficulty and it didn’t say whether to put level one or level two monster groups out does anyone know what you default to if it doesn’t explicitly say what level?

6. Each villain is fun enough that you'll want to try them a few times. They all feel similar and different enough that they make the game very enjoyable each time.

9. The game relies on players to balance each other out. There is not built in mechanic to do that. If two players start to develop a vendetta, there could be one or two who run away with the win.

I've been very curious about Dominare and been wanting to play it for a long time. I've hesitated on purchasing it because I wasn't sure how my group would like it, but I think now that they probably would like it after all. At least it's worth a shot I think.

  
Anyway, AEG doesn't even have the Tempest games on their website anymore. Anyone know if they've stopped any kind of support for the game and that it won't see any new reprints? Amazon UK wants 120 pounds for a game but there's a place in Sweden were I could snag it for the normal price. But I want to hold off for a while so hence my question to you.

I wanted to get feedback from someone who had preordered a game from this site and may of had the same issue as me or could clarify something since it’s my first time doing a preorder. 


I placed an order a couple days ago for 5 games, 4 of items being a preorder for Fireball Island and it’s 3 expansions. I have already been charged the correct amount of all 5 games and they all show on my invoice. However, when I access my order on their webpage and look at the invoice, underneath the main game (Fireball island, the curse of Vul-Kar) it says: “This product cannot be reordered because it's out of stock.” Then at the bottom of the invoice there’s an action button that says ‘reorder,’ which I have not clicked. Now, if you access the main game on their site it now shows OOS. 


I would just like to know if my order has went through or not. Seeing the message confuses me, but I don’t know if it just shows the message because they are now OOS or that I won’t be getting the preorder? I’ve already tried calling their facility but it goes to voicemail and I’m unable to leave a message. I’ve also emailed but have not heard a response. 

If anyone had any info or help with this I would appreciate it. Thank you in advance.

The problem with bullshit simulators is that because everything is random, you can never actually strategize in advance.

Most of these games turn into simple tradeoffs between complete the objective or slow the bullshit. This simplicity ensures that there is almost no strategy involved in winning a game, since there is always an optimal point of break-even with the bullshit.

 I have been an avid board gamer ever since my senior year of high school.  I'd always go to the hobby shops around my area to look at the newest board games coming out. I have a decent collection of board games my problem is though that I can't find  anyone to play these games with.

 None of my friends or family members are interested in board games. Which is a shame cause I have a round 8 games and I haven't even opened yet.

I live in Sussex County NJ. Are there any groups that I can possibly  join? 

Thanks!

Conflict, negotiation, dice throwing and other randomness typify American games as well as an emphasis on aesthetics and design decisions like miniatures.

My favorite American board games include:

* **Twilight Imperium Fourth Edition** - an obvious choice, I know (but don't worry if you have different reasons), this day long, table hog space opera epic combines depth and complexity to provide a feeling of grand, meaningful choices and challenge with incredibly intuitive and streamlined gameplay to make it so fun and rewarding and deceptively accessible.

Big and scary and beautiful, yet so refined; Twilight Imperium refuses to bog down in when it really should. This game of unwieldy proportions, this game which looks as though it's supposed to be - that looks like it should be an experience filled with deep, isolating, unsocial, calculated thought set to the sound of yawns of everyone else around the table defies all that.  As a first time player make their first moves, they realize this game isn't a heavy, exhausting boulder pressing down on their shoulders but a well weighted dumbbell that's a delight to lift.  Players realize their turns aren't as tough as they though, that there is an atmosphere providing room to talk... room to negotiate!... room to laugh and yell and gasp!  Of course deep planning is still made, there are tense and quiet and even slow moments but it's all executed so well.  The opposite of multiplayer solitaire, possibly my favorite aspect of Twilight Imperium is that no matter what is happening, everyone is still kept invested in the board.  Intrigued to find out what the other players might do.  This is a game where even when it isn't your turn, it still feels like you're having a go - even when strategic actions aren't being played.  Twilight Imperium is a heavy game that's light, a thinking game that manages to get everyone talking, a long game that feels so quick because it's always so interesting and fun!  A true masterpiece.

* **Cosmic Encounter** - *another* obvious choice.  It is light, quirky, engaging and screams replay-ability.

This is a game, that like Twilight Imperium, refuses to let players around the table become bored.  All of the variable powers set ontop of a simple yet deep fighting and alliance-brokering foundation really make this game special.  I'd argue this is the closest thing to TI4-lite because it captures that very same atmosphere which gets players engaged and talking and yelling and laughing!

It is not everyday when someone posts about news from Polish board game scene. This week, however, quite a shocking news were unveiled and I think it's worth passing the info to the rest of the world.

As you may or may not know, [Marcin ""Senior"" Ropka](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/84236/marcin-senior-ropka), author of [Alien Artifacts](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181293/alien-artifacts) and [Take a Train](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/182799/take-train), and a designer of an upcoming game [Solar City](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/248182/solar-city), was working for a Polish game publisher [Games Factory](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamepublisher/35960/games-factory), has announced yesterday that he'll be leaving Games Factory.

This would have been just a normal decision - we all change our jobs from time to time - if it wasn't for the reason. On Wednesday, Polish board gaming world went through quite a shock after it was revealed that Games Factory was lying about the delays for the crowdfunded Polish edition of expansions for [Raiders of the North Sea](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/170042/raiders-north-sea).

For months, backers were told by the publisher that the expansions are printed and only held by Custom Office. GF even posted e-mail screenshots from Custom Agency that were supposed to be a proof of them trying to deal with the situation (you can see them [here](https://staticwspieram.pl/ckfinder/userfiles/30944/0fc11aa3bf1c81dfbafb1883e7860c31-58b60601da02672350c9a88915c7af12.jpg), but they're in Polish).

Only recently, one of the backers asked RotN designer, [Shem Philips](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/12547/shem-phillips), if he was aware of the situation. And the response started the crisis: [https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Yu\_Z41zTytI/W33jpz3cSSI/AAAAAAAANbk/LPRz4ra6RhQzjiJF23dF2naGIa5CZEALwCLcBGAs/s1600/Kryzys.jpg](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Yu_Z41zTytI/W33jpz3cSSI/AAAAAAAANbk/LPRz4ra6RhQzjiJF23dF2naGIa5CZEALwCLcBGAs/s1600/Kryzys.jpg)

It was a shock for everyone to learn that GF was actually lying about Custom Office delays, but instead haven't paid for the print that happened 8 MONTHS AGO.

Obviously, everyone wanted a comment from GF, who finally released a statement saying they're sorry that they've lied about it, that what Shem said was truth and that they've tried behind the scenes to fix the situation and find some external sources to fund the print (despite [a successful crowdfunding campaign on Wspieram.to](https://wspieram.to/najezdzcydodatki), where they've collected 62 907 PLN for them (\~ 17 000 USD)). They've promised they'll return the money to backers, although people are being very cautious about that promise.

This isn't the end of it, however. Games Factory hasn't only run the campaign for RotN expansions in Polish, but has also a few other finished campaigns that haven't been delivered to backers. On 14 June 2016, they've successfully ran [a cf to fund Polish edition of Mage Wars: Arena and MW: Academy](https://wspieram.to/magewars), with the result of 68 156 PLN (\~ 18 450 USD). Backers were promised they'll get their MW products in November 2016, but they had to wait until June 2018 to get Mage Wars: Academy. MW: Arena hasn't still be delivered, but backers are being told that the shipment to them should start after mid-October 2018. Some are still hopeful, others aren't.

But that's still not all of it! They also have undelivered Valeria: Card Kingdoms Polish edition (with an original promise of delivery in March 2018) and Board Game Creative Kit (January 2018), which was also cf [on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1689336268/board-game-creative-kit).

Only recently the campaign to fund Solar City was finished [on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1689336268/solar-city-a-solarpunk-game). The publisher has said they've secured funding for the print, so it shouldn't be affected by the recent revelations, but, once again, it has to be taken in with a grain of salt.

I'm sure many of you seen similar things happening on Kickstarter before, but for us in Poland, that's the first case where a company has done such a dodgy move. The uproar caused by this in our country is huge (well, at least among board gamers) and it might have some consequences to how people view crowdfunding board games, which is very sad. A lot of commenters have suggested backers to look to withdraw their pledges for the undelivered campaigns where possible.

Personally, I hope that this whole thing will not affect Solar City delivery and that the duo of Marcin Ropka and Viola Kijowska (designers of Solar City) will continue releasing new games through a much more reputable publisher in the future.

P.S.2. For those who understand Polish, there's also a great summary article available [here](http://www.planszowkiwedwoje.pl/2018/08/games-factory-kamstwa-i-crowdfunding.html) with responses from the involved parties.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not everyday when someone posts about news from Polish board game scene. This week, however, quite a shocking news were unveiled and I think it&amp;#39;s worth passing the info to the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may or may not know, &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/84236/marcin-senior-ropka""&gt;Marcin &amp;quot;Senior&amp;quot; Ropka&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181293/alien-artifacts""&gt;Alien Artifacts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/182799/take-train""&gt;Take a Train&lt;/a&gt;, and a designer of an upcoming game &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/248182/solar-city""&gt;Solar City&lt;/a&gt;, was working for a Polish game publisher &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamepublisher/35960/games-factory""&gt;Games Factory&lt;/a&gt;, has announced yesterday that he&amp;#39;ll be leaving Games Factory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would have been just a normal decision - we all change our jobs from time to time - if it wasn&amp;#39;t for the reason. On Wednesday, Polish board gaming world went through quite a shock after it was revealed that Games Factory was lying about the delays for the crowdfunded Polish edition of expansions for &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/170042/raiders-north-sea""&gt;Raiders of the North Sea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For months, backers were told by the publisher that the expansions are printed and only held by Custom Office. GF even posted e-mail screenshots from Custom Agency that were supposed to be a proof of them trying to deal with the situation (you can see them &lt;a href=""https://staticwspieram.pl/ckfinder/userfiles/30944/0fc11aa3bf1c81dfbafb1883e7860c31-58b60601da02672350c9a88915c7af12.jpg""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but they&amp;#39;re in Polish).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only recently, one of the backers asked RotN designer, &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/12547/shem-phillips""&gt;Shem Philips&lt;/a&gt;, if he was aware of the situation. And the response started the crisis: &lt;a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Yu_Z41zTytI/W33jpz3cSSI/AAAAAAAANbk/LPRz4ra6RhQzjiJF23dF2naGIa5CZEALwCLcBGAs/s1600/Kryzys.jpg""&gt;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Yu_Z41zTytI/W33jpz3cSSI/AAAAAAAANbk/LPRz4ra6RhQzjiJF23dF2naGIa5CZEALwCLcBGAs/s1600/Kryzys.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This resulted in a real loss of momentum as players were able to stake their claim on their own little corner of the world to fulfill their quests etc, and then any common objectives like Ygdrassil or the next Ragnarok territory literally could not be fought over, because their village spots were fully occupied by a single player, they had already been pillaged and there was no way to force a conflict to kill off more units or generally move the game forward.  Has this happened to anyone else?  Are we playing the game wrong?  The premise, tone and initial balance of the game seemed great, but it all really lost stea towards the end.  Just trying to figure out why.  Cheers in advance.

[EDIT]

Thanks for all the responses.  I think we did play a few things incorrectly.  It's possible that the horns stat was not properly respected after a while (we did try to keep an eye on this...though we might have let it slide as it got late and we got tired).

I think the main problem for us was that we incorrectly did NOT end the action phase after all territories had been pillaged.  We kept playing until everyone was out of rage, meaning that people could move into a territory quickly and pillage it uncontested without any penalty, and we were just left trying to burn through our remaining rage when the phase already should have ended and the threat of battle had already subsided due to early pillaging.  I think playing this rule correctly will have a really big impact on our future plays.

FWIW, we did play the Invade and March actions correctly, and I still wonder whether the March action might be a little too powerful because if you have minis remaining from the previous age at the beginning of a new age and the other players have been largely wiped out, you can easily March to entirely occupy a territory with no potential from retaliation from your opponents.  I wonder whether limiting the March action to 2 models might be a little more balanced because it would make it impossible to fill all the village spots in a territory as a result of one action, and would give every player a chance to respond to your movement before you can pillage.  Of course I also acknowledge that I have only played this game twice and I probably don't know what I am talking about yet :P.

A final thought, which others have mentioned, is that while turtling into a specific territory for quests might be still be possible, it's very unlikely to be a winning strategy.  I arguably used this strategy more than anyone in our games (to turtle and multi-pillage Ygdrassil, no less), and I still lost because other players were able to dominate strength quests and Valhalla points elsewhere.

Thanks for the feedback!  Definitely clarified some things for me.

[EDIT X2]

Played the game twice again today.  Admittedly it was 2 players this time versus 3 last night, so that might affect the experience as well, but with these corrected rules the game played really well.

3. Mountain ranges. Right now the only person I know of who makes the mountain ranges is sickdave on BGG. He's currently taking orders. Not sure how well they'll fit on regular edition boards.

4. Army markers. I've seen some of these on BGG and other places where people custom make these. I think they might be a tad excessive.

5. Custom battle dice. If War of the Ring has one fault (especially the anniversary/collectors editions) it's the boring battle dice. Pimp out your games with some special versions of these.

It's not as pretty as the old flash version since the turn readout is all text but it should still make your resolution phase faster and more accurate.

Features: 

- All basic and advanced cards from the Space Alert base game. 

- Automatic processing of all player actions, threats damage, and threat actions. 

- Randomizes and appropriately applies damage tiles.

- Turn by turn text based readout of your game results. 

- End game scoring provided.

I'm happy to announce that I'm going to self-publish my first board game, entitled CardsLab Countries:

[https://imgur.com/a/58EbZWd](https://imgur.com/a/58EbZWd)

The game will be published first in Portuguese and in English later on.

It's an educational board game and it's the first one of a series of themes that will be launched in the next years. The first one as you can see is about Geography :)

It has simple mechanic. It's a turn based game, each of them composed by 5 phases, where the players can complete missions with their cards in hand, obtain points and earn special cards that change the course of the game, and challenge other players with questions from his cards or battle against all the players in the table, by choosing the best country features. The player who reaches a certain number of points or eliminates all the opponents wins the game.

The game is being developed and tested since 2016, when our company won an award on a Gamification Event held in Portugal (Novabase Gameshifters 2016).

Feel free to comment or give any advice or suggestions.

Do you still play it? If so, how often does it make it to the table? Has the game held up after repeated plays? Has it moved up or down in your personal ranking? Has it been replaced by a newer, similar game? Has it replaced a game?

**Description from Boardgamegeek**:

2212: Ginkgo Biloba, the oldest and strongest tree in the world, has become the symbol of a new method for building cities in symbiosis with nature. Humans have exhausted the resources that the Earth offered them, and humanity must now develop cities that maintain a delicate balance between resource production and consumption. Habitable space is scarce, however, and mankind must now face the challenge of building ever upwards. To develop this new type of city, you will gather a team of experts around you, and try to become the best urban planner for Ginkgopolis.

In  Ginkgopolis, the city tiles come in three colors: yellow, which provides victory points; red, which provides resources; and blue, which provides new city tiles. Some tiles start in play, and they're surrounded by letter markers that show where new tiles can be placed.

On a turn, each player chooses a card from his hand simultaneously. Players reveal these cards, adding new tiles to the border of the city in the appropriate location or placing tiles on top of existing tiles. Each card in your hand that you don't play is passed on to your left-hand neighbor, so keep in mind how your play might set up theirs!

When you add a new tile to the city, you take a ""power"" card of the same color, and these cards provide you additional abilities during the game, allowing you to scale up your building and point-scoring efforts.

Most guys and gals I played with played only to win - to ""go infinite"", as it's called, when this expensive hobny finances itself by the tournament prices you get.

In comes Mage Knight.

I read about it by chance when discovering Boardgamegeek by the recommendation of a friend, and I was awe-struck. A complex strategy game, in its puzzles not unlike MtG, that you could play by yourself? So I became a solo board gamer. 

But not for long. When I told everyone I knew about this crazy thing of solo gaming, I found out that a lot of my acquaintances from the more casual circles of Magic were playing board games, too (and alienated a lot of the non-nerds). So I got sucked into that.

In a few weeks my view on analog gaming completely changed. Suddenly I was playing multiple times a week, and I loved every minute of it. 

I started collecting games, furiously, sometimes buying multiple games at once, multiple times a month. I'm sure most of you know this quite well. "" Aquisition phase"", as they call it.

But something started to change. I bought more and more hardcore games, since that was the natural progression as I thought. 
And as far as I moved up on the complexity scale on BGG, my passion for the hobby started to fade.

I decided to change something. So I tried something radically different. Instead of playing Rosenberg's and Lacerda's, I played Jenga and Junk art. And I was completely baffled. These games that I frowned upon for so long for being ""beginner's games"" or ""child's play"", I enjoyed so much more. I started to look up from boards and into the broad smiles of my fellow gamers.

I still play a lot of strategy games. But I began to love the simple, social side of gaming a lot more. And I always look forward to the end of gaming events, for then we play what's called the "" silly games"".

I love this hobby, more than ever. Thanks for reading this :-)

The kind that over-analyses everything, AP-prone, stalls the game until he finds the best outcome, winning at all costs even to the detriment of fun.

My brother-in-law plays with my wife and I regularly. We're slowly expanding the group and introducing other family and friends that are interested in playing board games. One of his friends (lets call him J for ease) recently found out about our game days and asked to be included. I noticed that he exhibits both analysis paralysis and a competitive streak.

While we don't insist that people play nice, J literally stalls games until he finds the optimal move. He'll go around the table asking of past moves in area control games. In a social deduction game J has asked us to re-announce moves / decisions in order to analyse reactions and expressions - not once - but repeatedly. In game with combination effects, he started breaking down every possible effect and interaction every single turn. J even starts counting cards in a card game. A single game of Cockroach Poker took 90 minutes to finish.

I'm not adverse to having different players at the table, some will be naturally better at some games, some will naturally grok games... but dealing with someone who plays to win, even if it means spoiling the fun of the day... I'm getting tired of this.

Sure I'm all about good sportsmanship, but if I wanted that environment, I'd play MtG competitively again. I  like to have varied players, but not one that spoils the fun just to win.

How have you guys dealt with this?

While each batch of students know each other pretty well, inter-year interaction is minimal and I'd like to improve that by starting a weekly boardgame night to give people a platform to meet people from other years. There are a core group of friends (4-6 people) that would be able to attend every week, so even if only a handful of people turn up we could start a game or two. Between us, we have a game collection of around 40-50 games. We'd be expecting about 20 people each week, although attendance would likely vary greatly each week due to work load and depending on whether or not people invite friends.

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest question I have now would be how to best structure the session. It's planned to be a very relaxed and social event, where the focus is not on the games but on meeting people, especially because we can't expect everyone to be boardgame enthusiasts. We don't want to have such a rigid structure that it discourages people from attending, but also don't want it to be without a plan entirely such that newcomers feel isolated for example. Should we intentionally break people up and form groups for them, or let them choose for themselves? Do we wait for most people to turn up, or start playing as and when people arrive? Should we start with party games or just let each group decide what they want to play? Originally I was thinking since its a weekly event, we could feature a game every week and talk about it for like 5-10 minutes at the start to introduce it to more people, but then thought that this was a bit much for a casual event such as this. Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

I also have questions regarding the first session specifically. For the first session, we were planning on holding a more formal introduction of how the event would work and ground rules. I have some rules in mind (No drinks/using phones at the tables, respect each other and the games), but are there any other important rules or reminders I should set at the start? Should we break out our entire collection to get people interested or just bring a couple every week and change it up each week? Nametags?

Thanks for reading, I'm really interested to hear what advice the community has on hosting events like this!
