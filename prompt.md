## Project-3 Presentation Prompt

Oh no, Reddit HQ is in a frenzy! A disgruntled, nefarious Reddit back-end developer has gone into every post hosted on Reddit and replaced the subreddit field with " ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ ". None of the subreddit links will populate with posts until the subreddit fields of each post are re-assigned!

Unfortunately, the Reddit data science team doesn't have the resources available to tackle the re-assignment of every single post across all of Reddit (the entire team is dilligently working on updating the atrocious interface of the homepage). Instead, Reddit is looking to contract this project out and hire a private consultant. The request for proposals asks that any private consultants (you) bidding for the job also develop a sample model, one which is the best classification model possible that can distinguish which of two subreddits of your choosing a particular post belongs, and give a presentation of model/process/results.

The audience will be Reddit's in-house data science team, and so will represent a **technical** audience. They will be evaluating your model results, approach, and overall technical prowess to determine if they will hire you to build more models to re-categorize the entirety of affected Reddit posts. It will be important to flex some of your understanding of data science concepts and principles, and convince Reddit that your sample model is performing impressively well.

Some recommendations of what to include (just to get you started): scraping strategy, compelling visuals, significant insights uncovered, noteable obstacles, description of the dataset, the most informative features, NLP strategy, Vectorizers used, interpret coefficients, any features you engineered, any outside data used, description of scaling or regularization if used, any hyperparameter tuning, directions explored, final model performance.

Presentation are to be **8 MINUTES** followed by 3 (+/-) minutes afterward for questions.

Presentations will begin promptly at 10am on Friday, September 7th.
